I have built a Code for analyzing the financial records of a company, using a given dataset. The dataset composed of arrays with two fields: Date and Profit/Losses, which can be seen in the index.js file. 

In this project I wrote a JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* I track what the total change in profits is from month to month and then found the average.

`(Total/(Number of months - 1))`

* The greatest increase in profits (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

When you open the console, you will will see the following results:
